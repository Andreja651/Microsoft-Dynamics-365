Dashboards / Reports    2           1         1

  3. Common Issues Identified
• Missing or weak form validation (e.g., email format, required fields)
• Permissions not enforced properly (e.g., deletion with read-only role)
• Workflow triggers are inconsistent or misconfigured
• Lack of feedback for empty states (e.g., blank dashboards)
• Duplicate records allowed without alerts
  4. Observations
• The system handles most standard use cases effectively.
• Edge cases and invalid data entry often slip through due to weak validations.
• Permissions and role-based restrictions require further configuration/testing.
• User experience improvements (like confirmation prompts, error messaging) are needed for smoother workflows.

  5. Next Steps
• Log and assign open bugs for resolution
• Re-test failed cases once bugs are fixed
• Prepare for Test Closure
